                    I understand that as a startup founder, venturing into the realm of artificial intelligence without
                    the necessary field expertise can be an incredibly challenging and inaccessible endeavour in today's world.
                    AI is a complex and rapidly evolving field that requires deep knowledge, technical proficiency, and a
                    comprehensive understanding of its intricacies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Embarking on such a journey as a startup founder without prior expertise means grappling with numerous hurdles
                    and limitations. The shortage of accessible resources, coupled with the absence of a strong foundation in AI,
                    can make it even more daunting. It's natural to feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and the constant
                    advancements that shape the AI landscape.

                <p>
                    Validating and testing a business idea in the AI field often necessitates the involvement of AI consultants or
                    dedicated teams. The costs associated with hiring these experts and building the required infrastructure can place
                    a significant burden on startups with limited resources. Furthermore, the collaborative process of integrating AI
                    expertise into the business model can be time-intensive, potentially delaying the product or service's development
                    and launch. Overcoming these hurdles requires careful budgeting, resource allocation, and effective project management
                    to navigate the complexities and make the most of available resources.
